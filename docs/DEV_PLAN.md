# OpenCraft development plan

**Status (2026-10-19):** Milestones 1–12, Milestone 13 (Settlements, all but its balance step 13.6b) and the play-test
response R1–R7 plus S1–S4 (sky and weather) are built and pushed; the realistic art pass is live. **Next: R8** (a talk
step), then "Pod channels by name"; 13.6b waits for the user to play Milestone 13. After those: the feel-and-feedback
interlude, the carry's era pieces, Milestone 14 (the space elevator).

> **This project is written entirely by AI coding agents.** Every session starts cold and every line read costs tokens.
> **Keeping the codebase small, modular and cheap to read is as important as any feature** (section 3.1, mandatory).

This is the plan of record: direction, rules, and what to build next. Settled decisions: `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Finished
work: `docs/history/` (read only to learn how something came to be). Player's manual: `docs/PLAYING.md`, `FACTORY.md`,
`TOWNS.md`. Future milestones: `docs/ROADMAP.md`; tech tree: `docs/TECH_TREE.md` (concept, its section 8 is the content
architecture) and `docs/TECH_ERAS.md` (each era's recipes). Read those only when planning.

## 0. Handover: read this first

A working browser factory game, live at <https://sidem.github.io/OpenCraft/>: a Rust → wasm engine and a thin
TypeScript/WebGL2 host. It has belts, power, research with five science packs, tiers Mk1–Mk5, steam, chemistry, nuclear,
compute, trains, drones, terraforming, orbit, towns, co-op for 2–4 players, biomes, rivers, plants, ruins, weather and music.

Before you change code:

1. Read this file, then `docs/CODEMAP.md`, then the nested `CLAUDE.md` of the area you work in.
2. `npm run build:wasm` (if `web/src/wasm` is missing), then `npm run check` for a green baseline.
3. Do one step of section 4, or one clean part of it, per session; stop green.
4. When a step is done: tick it here, update the status line, add a line to section 6. Players will notice it: a line in
   `web/src/patch-notes.md` (newest `## date · title` first). Structural change: `docs/CODEMAP.md` in the same commit.

Ground rules (details in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`): **never push to `main` without asking** (a push deploys the live site);
commit only when asked; PowerShell and the file tools on this Windows machine (the Bash tool fails); performance first,
dependencies justified; explain things to the user in plain language.

## 1. Where the project is heading

A browser game between **Minecraft** and **Satisfactory**: a fully editable voxel world that you mine, shape and
industrialise. Not a Minecraft clone; its conventions can be broken freely.

### Pillars

1. **Everything is physical.** Items travel on belts, machines are blocks in the world, the world is the material.
2. **Finite ground pushes you outward.** Deposits run dry after a long time; distance, depth and scale become the problems.
3. **Terrain is something you engineer.** Cut, fill, flatten, tunnel, flood: by drone, the genre's signature feature here.
4. **Automation replaces your hands at every scale:** mining, then logistics, then construction.
5. **Every tier adds a new kind of problem, not just recipes:** quantity → power → distance → terrain → fluids → scale.

### The decisions that bind new work (all of them: `docs/DECISIONS.md`)

- **Needs before techs** (2026-10-16): new work gives the player a problem its tech solves. No more multiplier layers
  (compute, orbit) and no more perk layers. Depth in existing systems beats new systems.
- **Peaceful**, no combat or PvE; pressure comes without enemies (R8). **Open-ended**: the megaproject unlocks, never ends.
- **Co-op 2–4 players**, lockstep over WebRTC with a deterministic core. **Old saves keep loading.** New generation rules
  apply to new worlds only (a world keeps its generator version).
- **Content is data:** tiers index tables, processing machines are spec rows (`docs/TECH_TREE.md` section 8).
- **Art moves away from Minecraft:** natural blocks photo-referenced, machines stylized (`docs/ART_HANDOVER.md`).

## 2. Architecture in brief

Rust (`crates/engine`) owns all game state and hot loops; TypeScript (`web/src`) does input, WebGL2, DOM and Web Audio,
reading bulk data (meshes, instances, sounds, textures) zero-copy from wasm memory. `Game` (`lib.rs`) is the facade, its
JS API split by area into `api/*.rs`. The deterministic core is `Sim` (`sim.rs`): `Game` changes it only by queuing
`Action`s, applied at the next 60 Hz tick; the core answers with `SimEvent`s. `Sim::state_hash` fingerprints the core
through the same canonical bytes saves use (`bytes.rs`, `save.rs`). Co-op is lockstep: the host stamps every action for
`tick + INPUT_DELAY` and clients compare state hashes every `CHECKSUM_TICKS`; bodies and loose items are replicated, not
simulated. Budgets for 4 players: under ~10 KB/s per client outside snapshots, the host's frame under 2 ms more than solo.

### Measured (2026-10-19, `bench_*` and `scripts/bench-flight.mjs` on the user's 32-hour save)

- A 30,000-belt, 3,000-processor base: a steady tick 148 µs (layout-sensitive: about ten passes a tick walk every
  processor to find a few of one kind; the same code padded to 528 bytes ticks in 131 µs), but any belt placed relinks the whole factory (3.4 ms) and
  `write_instances` writes 1 M floats (0.5 ms) a frame. Towns plan every stage in 92 ms at once, one stage in 16 ms.
- Flying over the 32-hour base: the engine's share of a frame averages 5.5 ms, p99 13.4 ms (streaming and meshing),
  2 frames in 1,200 over 16.6 ms. Wasm 575 KB gzipped, JS 125 KB.

### Known limitations

1. Two tabs on the same world overwrite each other's saves (the later save wins).
2. TypeScript still mirrors a few engine constants (`web/src/CLAUDE.md` lists them); replace with getters when touched.
3. Item and belt instances aren't interpolated between ticks (only the camera is).
4. In co-op every action applies about 70 ms plus the round trip after it is made; a name change applies at the next
   session; hosting can't be stopped without leaving the page; the TURN relay is untested (the user adds its secrets).
5. The explored map, pins and blueprints live in one browser per world: co-op clients keep none, exports carry none.
6. Swimming and pumps treat every flowing-water cell as a whole block (the mesher draws them finer).

## 3. Engineering rules for all new work

### 3.1 Keep the codebase small and cheap to work on (TOP PRIORITY, mandatory)

Tokens go to reading code, exploring for where things live, failed build-test loops and re-learning the project each
session. Structure decides all four. **Treat context cost like frame time: a budget you measure and defend.** If a change
would break these rules, restructure first, in its own commit.

**Changes stay local.** One feature, one module or folder: new files plus at most one registration line per table. If one
feature edits five central files, fix the structure. `Game` stays a thin facade; `api/*.rs` methods only forward. Content
(blocks, items, recipes, machines, techs, ore settings) is data, code is per kind of behaviour. Variants are data, never
booleans or a block per tier. Simulation and presentation are separate modules: the core never reads presentation, hands
or the API (`scripts/check-map.mjs` checks it). Boring, explicit code: no macro tricks, no ECS, no abstraction before its
second instance.

**Budgets** (`scripts/check-size.mjs`, part of `npm run check`):

| Kind | Warn | Fail |
|---|---|---|
| Rust / TS source file, tests excluded | 400 lines | 600 lines |
| CSS file (one per UI component) | 300 lines | 500 lines |
| Any `CLAUDE.md` | 60 lines | 100 lines |
| A doc in `docs/` (not `history/`) | 24 KB | 40 KB |
| The session-start read: root `CLAUDE.md`, this plan, `CODEMAP.md` | 48 KB | 64 KB |

Docs are budgeted in bytes: a line budget only made lines longer. Split a file over its warn limit before adding to it.

**Readability.** Tests live in `src/<module>/tests.rs`, never inline. Every module starts with a header of at most ~15
lines (what it owns, invariants, how to extend), then public items, then private helpers. Unique, searchable names. One
source of truth: never mirror a constant between Rust and TS (expose a getter) or between code and docs (point to it).
Delete dead code at once. Comments say *why*.

**Docs are maps, not history.** `CODEMAP.md` is an index, one line per module; detail lives in module headers. This plan
holds only the current work; a finished milestone moves to `docs/history/`, the next comes in from `docs/ROADMAP.md`
detailed to steps with where, how and done-when. Operational how-tos live in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.

**Feedback loops fast and quiet.** `npm run check` before every commit. Prefer headless Rust scenario tests (build through
actions, run ticks, assert on state or `describe` text) over the browser pane, which is for final visual proof. Quiet
flags, filtered output. Newtypes and exhaustive `match`es let the compiler list what a change must touch.

**Sessions.** One scoped step, finished green. Read line ranges and symbols, not whole files. Every milestone ends with a
cleanup step: budgets clean, code map current, plan compressed, dead code gone.

### 3.2 Performance

Hot loops and state stay in Rust; bulk data passes zero-copy; measure before and after anything that could cost frame
time (`bench_*`, `scripts/bench-flight.mjs`).

### 3.3 Wasm size

Report gzipped sizes when the build grows (`npx vite build`). The rules (no float formatting, no new std sorts, no new
crates without reason) are in `crates/engine/CLAUDE.md`.

### 3.4 Determinism (required for co-op)

The core (world edits, factory, deposits, inventories, crafting, research, towns) produces identical state on every
machine from the same seed and actions. Core code never depends on frame time, on which chunks are loaded (use the
`*_anywhere` accessors), on the camera, the local player, UI or presentation queries, on hash-map iteration order, on
wall-clock time or anything from JS. Queries never create or modify core state. Everything that changes the core is an
action applied at a tick boundary; presentation never feeds back. (A future native server will need `libm` on both sides.)

### 3.5 Style and docs to keep in sync

Match the surrounding code. Every engine feature gets tests in its module. Anything players see: the player's manual
(`docs/PLAYING.md`, `FACTORY.md`, `TOWNS.md`) and the patch notes. README.md is the pitch and setup only.

## 4. Now: the rest of the play-test response

The 2026-10-16 review and the user's 32-hour play-test became steps R1–R8 (`docs/history/CHANGELOG_R.md` has the
findings and every finished step). Rules that bind every step: content architecture per `docs/TECH_TREE.md` section 8;
each save-format change bumps `SAVE_VERSION` with a migration and a fixture test; golden hashes are re-recorded only on
purpose, noted in the step; new ids append (EXTENDING.md says where the next free one comes from); each new look gets a
placeholder layer and a `docs/ART_HANDOVER.md` request line; fluids other than water ride belts as canister items.

- [x] R1–R7 and S1–S4 (talks, rivers, plants, ambient sound, music, ruins, decor, sky and weather): built and pushed.
  Not built from them: the era as a music context (waits for an industrial or space piece), rain splashes, lightning,
  snow on machines, decor slabs and stairs (need non-cube meshing).
- [ ] **R8 Pressure without combat (talk).** Pick one or two with the user from `docs/ROADMAP.md` (subsidence, mine
  flooding, storms, pollution that thins plants and solar). Each must reuse existing systems and stay deterministic.
- [ ] **Pod channels by name (small).** A launcher and a pad pick their channel in their panel (a colour and a name), not
  by facing (`factory/process/pods.rs`). Save version bump with a migration: the facing becomes the colour.
- [ ] **13.6b Balance from the user's next play-test** (`scripts/inspect-save.mjs`): order sizes, upkeep rates, perk
  rates and the harbour's price, once the user has played Milestone 13. Their latest save (2026-10-17, 32.4 h) has not
  yet researched Settlements.
- **Parked, fit in where a session has room:** P3 cheaper box instances, P4 an incremental co-op checksum, P5 small TS
  savings (`docs/history/CHANGELOG_M12.md`); a power beam drawn from satellites to rectennas; incremental `relink` if
  big bases hitch on placing (measured above).
- **The user's to do:** add the two TURN secrets (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` section 4), then test with `&relay` on both ends.
- **Only if placing feels laggy in co-op:** show your own edits at once in the render cache, undo them if the core
  disagrees, never touch the core (`interaction.rs`). A real resync logged by a client becomes a replayable test.

**After these:** the feel-and-feedback interlude (`docs/ROADMAP.md`: the instrument with few voices and a distance cap,
follow one item, timelapse; then seismic prospecting and site bonuses), the carry's era pieces (splitter addresses and the
tally only), Milestone 14. Art goes on in parallel (`docs/ART_HANDOVER.md`).

## 5. Open questions for the user

Ask when the step that needs the answer comes up. Record answers in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

| Needed by | Question |
|---|---|
| R8 | Which pressure without combat, if any: subsidence, mine flooding, storms, pollution? |
| Any UI step | A colour-blind palette for tier colours (pips and "Mk" text are there regardless)? |
| A world-settings step | Should old worlds be able to opt into newer generation (rivers, trees, ruins)? Should far deposits seen once get a map pin? |
| Music | A sea piece; industrial and space pieces (with the era as a context). |

## 6. Recent changes

- **2026-10-19: docs restructure.** The session-start read went from about 188 KB to under 48 KB: `CODEMAP.md` is an
  index (detail lives in module headers), decisions moved to `docs/DECISIONS.md`, finished work to `docs/history/`,
  stale sections dropped from this plan and `WORKFLOW.md`. `npm run check` gained byte budgets for docs and
  `scripts/check-map.mjs` (map paths exist, every module is mapped, the core reads no presentation). Then the 12 source
  files over 400 lines were split along their seams (table rows into set or era files, `frame.rs`, `factory/tick.rs`,
  `pause.ts`, overlays into `outlines.ts`), no behaviour change. Last, what only one kind of processor keeps (well,
  research unit, debt, launches, depot wants, drone fleet) moved from six `Processor` fields into one enum
  (`process/extra.rs`): 528 to 464 bytes, save bytes unchanged.
- **2026-10-18:** real 3D item models, the water rework (smooth surfaces, still, flowing, rapid and falling water),
  per-block texture turning, and the realistic art batches (records in `docs/history/CHANGELOG_R.md`).
